# Venixxino: Interactive 3D Atomic Structure Visualizer

Venixxino is an educational web application designed to help visualize the electronic configurations of the first 20 elements of the periodic table. Using interactive 3D graphics powered by A-Frame, you can explore how electrons are arranged in shells around the nucleus for each element, making abstract chemistry concepts engaging and accessible.
(Also, the name makes no sense, just sounded cool)

## Features
- **Interactive 3D Atom Viewer:** Visualizes atoms with animated electron orbits and labeled nucleus.
- **Element Selector:** Choose any element from Hydrogen (1) to Calcium (20) using a sidebar dropdown.
- **Dynamic Visualization:** Automatically updates the number of shells, electrons, and their positions based on the selected element's electronic configuration.
- **Educational Labels:** Displays the element's name, symbol, total number of electrons, and electronic configuration directly in the 3D scene.
- **Customizable Environment:** Change the 3D background environment for a more immersive experience.
- **Kid-Friendly UI:** Simple sidebar controls and clear visuals designed for young learners.

## How It Works
- The sidebar on the top right lets users select an element and change the environment.
- The main 3D scene shows:
  - A nucleus at the center.
  - Electron shells (rings) and animated electrons orbiting the nucleus.
  - Text above the nucleus with the element's name and symbol.
  - Text in front of the nucleus showing the number of electrons and the electronic configuration.
- All visualizations update instantly when a new element is selected.

## Technologies Used
- [A-Frame](https://aframe.io/) for 3D rendering and animation
- HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for UI and logic
